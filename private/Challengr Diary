Challengr Diary

Tuesday 3rd February

My first post.

Today I will be attempting to implement modal windows.
Also hope to figure out how to render access denied if id's don't match.

Hook to prevent users from accessing routes:

onBeforeAction: function() {
    var doc = [collection].findOne(this.params._id);
    if (! ownsDocument(Meteor.userId(), doc)) {
      this.render('accessDenied');
    } else {
      this.next();
    }
  }


4th Feb:

Added ability to add teams into tournaments
Added server-side authentication for update and insert of teams and tournaments.

Trying to figure out how to prevent spoofing from allowing people to access restricted routes.
